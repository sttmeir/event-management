# Simple Event Management Application

## Usage
After starting the application, the initial data will be loaded automatically. You can test the basic following functionalities:

1) Event creation: the application will automatically create an event during startup.
2) Visitor registration for an event: The application will automatically register a visitor for the created event.
3) Displaying events: The application will list all events along with their details in the console.

Implemented methods can be tested in the **DataLoader class**.

Also, all of the service methods are defined in the EventService interface for convenience. 

Questions: why do we need DTOs as written in the task manual?
